# demolished-rail

This repository contains a TypeScript animation framework called **demolished-rail**, designed for creating complex and dynamic animations with ease. The framework provides a structured approach to building animations using scenes, entities, and a sequence controller. It also includes features like BPM synchronization, beat and tick events, and audio analysis (FFT) to create interactive and audio-reactive visualizations.

## Features

* **Scene-based animation:** Organize animations into scenes with defined start times and durations.
* **Entity management:** Create and manage individual animatable entities within scenes.
* **Sequence control:** Orchestrate the playback of scenes in a sequence.
* **BPM synchronization:** Synchronize animations with beats per minute (BPM).
* **Beat and tick events:** Trigger events on beats and ticks for precise timing control.
* **Audio analysis (FFT):** Analyze audio frequencies to create audio-reactive visualizations.
* **Canvas-based rendering:** Uses HTML5 Canvas for rendering animations.
